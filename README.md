# pharmacy-website-django

This website is created specifically for a pharmacy. On this platform, customers can register and purchase medicines. The website offers full CRUD functionality, including an 'add to cart' feature. Moreover, it provides a unique feature for users: they can upload a medical prescription to identify medicines and seamlessly add them to their cart. To develop this website, I utilized the Python-Django framework, Bootstrap for the front-end, and Django's ORM for database management. Additionally, I integrated Tesseract-OCR to implement the special prescription upload functionality.
